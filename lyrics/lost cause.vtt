00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:01.376
Something's in the...

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.933
Something's in the air right now

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.353
Like I'm losing track of time

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.648
Like I don't really care right now

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.191
But maybe that's fine

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.654
You weren't even there that day

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.614
I was waiting on you

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.949
You you

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.410
I wonder if you were aware that day

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:39.414
Was the last straw for me
And I knew

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:44.253
I sent you flowers

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:47.756
Did you even care

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.717
You ran the shower

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:55.055
And left them by the stairs

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.016
Ooh ooh ooh

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.561
Eh eh eh eh

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.146
Thought you had your **** together

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.233
But damn I was wrong

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.444
You ain't nothin but a lost cause

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:12.489
And this ain't nothin'
like it once was

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.451
I know you think you're such an outlaw

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:18.954
But you got no job

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:22.124
You ain't nothin'
But a lost cause

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:25.294
And this ain't nothin'
like it once was

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:29.548
I know you think you're such an outlaw

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.924
But you got no job

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.844
I used to think you were shy

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.180
But maybe you just Had
nothin on your mind

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:43.186
Maybe you were thinkin â€˜Bout
yourself all the time

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.565
I used to wish you were mine

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.943
But that was way before I realized

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:58.160
Someone like you Would always
be so easy to find

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.413
So easy

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.000
Easy

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.377
Mmm mmm mmm

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.884
Gave me no flowers

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.220
Wish I didn't care

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:20.349
You'd be gone for hours

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:24.227
Could be anywhere

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.273
Ooh ooh ooh

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:31.360
Ah ah ah ah

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.944
Thought you would've grown eventually

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.906
But you proved me wrong

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.992
You ain't nothing but a lost cause

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.120
And this ain't nothing
like it once was

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:46.166
I know you think you're such an outlaw

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.752
But you got no job

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.713
You ain't nothing but a lost cause

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.800
And this ain't nothing
like it once was

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:59.096
I know you think you're such an outlaw

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.431
But you got no job

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.643
What did I tell you

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.771
Don't get complacent

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.732
It's time to face it now

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:14.194
Now now now now

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.447
What did I tell you

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.700
Don't get complacent

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.578
It's time to face it now

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:26.164
Now now now now
